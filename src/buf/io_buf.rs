/// The `IoBuf` trait is implemented by buffer types that can be passed to
/// io-uring operations. Users will not need to use this trait directly, except
/// for the [`slice`] method.
///
/// # Slicing
///
/// Because buffers are passed by ownership to the runtime, Rust's slice API
/// (`&buf[..]`) cannot be used. Instead, `tokio-uring` provides an owned slice
/// API: [`slice()`]. The method takes ownership fo the buffer and returns a
/// `Slice<Self>` type that tracks the requested offset.
///
/// # Implementation notes
///
/// Buffers passed to `io-uring` operations must reference a stable memory
/// region. While the runtime holds ownership to a buffer, the pointer returned
/// by `stable_ptr` must remain valid even if the `IoBuf` value is moved.
///
/// [`slice()`]: IoBuf::slice
